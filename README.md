# Me
I'm currently an undergraduate student in physics dept. at Fudan University;

love playing table-tennis in leisure times,or playing games like clash royale etc.(well,used to..the game is terrible now. )

I guess there should be more to show you,but I'm just stressed out after an entire final season..hope I'll be alright,

so see you next time.
